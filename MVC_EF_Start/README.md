Here I Used MVC_EF_Start as code base to build the task as it contains the boiler plate for Connection string and all other functions.

First we need to insert data to DB that can be done by hitting  /DataBaseExample/DatabaseOperations this will the sample data to the database.

After that we can if we hit  /DataBaseExample/LINQOperations this will run the both queries 

1)List all orders where a product is sold for product 3

2)For a given product, find the order where it is sold the maximum

I performed both the queries for product ID 3
